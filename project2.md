Introduction
------------
Now that you are more familiar with the backend,
you can make a complete Web application for your 2nd project.

For this project, you will **do this project in pairs**.

You and the Ironhack staff will also vote for your favorites
and award three medals: Bronze 🥉, Silver 🥈, and Gold 🥇.

Here are some examples of past projects:
- [GiftHub](https://ironhack-gifthub.herokuapp.com/)
- [What the Q](https://what-the-q.herokuapp.com/)
- [Unbounded](https://unbounded.herokuapp.com/)
- [Read Me If You Can](https://read-me-if-you-can.herokuapp.com/)

Updated Technical Requirements
------------------------------
You app must:

1. **Use Express** as a foundation.
2. **Use Mongoose** for models and database communication.
3. **Have 2 models _or more_**.
   Having one for users is a no-brainer.
   The other one(s) should represent the main functionality of your app.
   Don't force it if having more thant two models doesn't make sense.
4. **Have validation on its models** with feedback for users
   if their submission is invalid.
5. **Include sign up, log in & log out functionality**
   with encrypted passwords (and/or social logins)
   and authorization (logged in users can do extra things).
6. **Have routes for all of CRUD** for models other than users.
   There should create, read, update and delete features
   even if they aren't all for the same model.
7. **Have a repo on GitHub**.
8. Have at least **1 commit per day** that you worked on it.
9. **Be deployed online** using Heroku, so anybody could use your app.

Responsive design **is not a requirement**.


Updated Deliverables
--------------------
- A **working full-stack application, built by you** that runs on a server.
- A **deploy of your app** on Heroku.
- The URL of the **GitHub repository** for your app.
- The URL of the **live app on the Internet**.
- The URL of the **slides for your app's presentation**.
- You must present your app during Project #2 final presentations
  (last day of Project #2 time).

Wireframes **are not a deliverable**. <br>
User stories **are not a deliverable**.


Presentations
-------------
Project #2's presentation will focus mostly on your project.
You **won't** have to talk much about yourselves or your background.
You should still **introduce yourselves briefly**.

### Format ###
- Talking with Slides: **3 minutes**
- Demo: **2 minutes**
- Total: **5 minutes**

### Attire ###
- Dress nicely for this and all final project presentations
  (last day of each project's time).
- Dress at least **one degree more elegantly** than you usually dress for class.
- _Examples_:
  * If you wear t-shirts every day, wear a button-down shirt.
  * If you wear jeans every day, wear some slacks.
  * If you wear sneakers every day, wear nicer shoes.

### Slide Applications ###
- All presentations will be done **from a staff member's computer**,
  so **your slides need to be online**.
- PowerPoint files, Keynote files or files of any kind **will not be accepted**.
- Suggested online slide applications:
  * [Slides](https://slides.com/)
  * [Prezi](https://prezi.com/)
  * [Google Slides](https://www.google.com/slides/about/)

### Presentation Structure ###
1. **Title Slide** (1 slide): your project's name & your name
2. **Project Elevator Pitch** (1-2 slides):
    * What is your project?
    * How does it work?
    * Why did you choose it?
3. **Technical Challenge** (1-2 slides):
    * What was **the most important** technical challenge you faced?
    * How did you overcome that challenge?
4. **Big Mistake** (1-2 slides):
    * What was **the biggest** mistake you made during this project?
    * What did you learn from it?
5. **Demo Slide** (1 slide): literally says "DEMO"
   with **a link** to your project so you can open it easily
6. **Closing Slide** (1 slide): your project's name, your name & a _"Thank You"_
7. **Total**: 6-9 slides

#### Presentation Structure Notes ####
- **Don't** include a slide just for the technologies.
- **Don't** include any code in your slides. Nobody will read it.
- **Don't** include a slide for GitHub graphs.
- **Don't** go into detail about how the app works.
  Your demo is where you want to do that.
- If you think that deviating from the structure improves your presentation,
  feel free to do so.
  This suggested structure is mostly for people who don't know what to do.

### Demo Tips ###
1. Plan what you are going to demo and **practice it on the live site**.
   That way you won't be surprised if something breaks on the live version.
2. **Deploy early** so you can squash bugs.
   There are _always_ bugs on the live site at first.
3. Add **link to your live project** to your DEMO slide
   so you can start it smoothly.
4. Your app's colors and sizing **might look different on the projector**.
   If you think it might be a problem, ask to test it beforehand.
5. If you app is on Heroku, **refresh it before you present**.
   Otherwise there will be a delay on the initial load.
