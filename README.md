#### Presentation Structure Notes ####
- **Don't** include a slide just for the technologies.
- **Don't** include any code in your slides. Nobody will read it.
- **Don't** include a slide for GitHub graphs.
- **Don't** go into detail about how the app works.
  Your demo is where you want to do that.
- If you think that deviating from the structure improves your presentation,
  feel free to do so.
  This suggested structure is mostly for people who don't know what to do.


### Demo Tips ###

1. Plan what you are going to demo and **practice it on the live site**.
   That way you won't be surprised if something breaks on the live version.
2. **Deploy early** so you can squash bugs.
   There are _always_ bugs on the live site at first.
3. Add **link to your live project** to your DEMO slide
   so you can start it smoothly.
4. Your app's colors and sizing **might look different on the projector**.
   If you think it might be a problem, ask to test it beforehand.


Grading Criteria (same as on platform)
--------------------------------------
- **Technical Requirements**: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

- **Creativity**: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something engaging and playable to the end user?

- **Code Quality**: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming?

- **Deployment**: Did you deploy your application to a public URL using GitHub Pages?

- **Total**: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

Score | Expectations
----- | ------------
**0** | Does not meet expectations.
**1** | Meets expectations. Good job!
**2** | Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!
